  subtitle: "Software Developer"
  description: "Currently based in McLean, Virginia ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, I work at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.n7.io/'>Nitrogen</a>, a cloud company focused on accelerating ecommerce businesses. Our vision is to create the best user experience for online shopping users. My background is diverse as a specialized generalist. In technology, I have a wide range of experiences, from development and architecture to cloud services. I have worked both as an individual contributor and in leadership roles. I apply the 3P's (People, Product, Process) to my work, and I love taking ideas from zero to reality, designing, building, and scaling products that solve hard problems. Whether itâ€™s architecting new systems or transforming existing ones, I focus on creating clear, maintainable, and forward-looking solutions."
